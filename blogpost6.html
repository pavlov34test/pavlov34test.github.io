  Russian manicure or pedicure is one of the most popular and effective techniques. With the help of an E-File it allows to quickly and easily take care of even most challenging hands. The possibilities of filing bits widely range. They allow to remove overgrown cuticles, smooth the surface of the nail, sand and give it a soft natural shine, remove gel polish, extended nails without soaking. Performed by a skilled nail pro, this E-File technology is the least traumatic procedure that is carried out “dry” without the use of cutting tools. Due to the fact that there is no need to soak nails before using the drill bits, they become less dry and brittle over time. In addition, the cuticle grows more slowly, which allows the hands to remain neat and well-groomed for a longer time. The same principle is applied to a pedicure plus removal of calluses and detailed polishing of skin on feet soles.
