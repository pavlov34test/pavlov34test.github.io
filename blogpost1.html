              How to temporarily fix a chipped nail polish.
            </h4>
            
            <p>
              
              With ordinary varnish, everything is very simple. You will need a regular sticker - absolutely any, even from a children's album, and a transparent varnish. Stick the sticker over the chip and apply clear varnish on top. Ready!<br>
              <br>
  If the gel polish is chipped, it will be more difficult to "mask" the damage. But if you want, nothing is impossible. As a rule, most often the gel polish is chipped off at the free edge of the nail. In such a situation, it is enough just to arm yourself with a nail file and file the desired area.<br>
  <br>
  To hide damage in another area, it is enough to pick up a regular varnish of the same color, apply a couple of layers and cover with a top.<br>
  <br>
  And, of course, the problem is easier to prevent than "cure". Remember that the varnish can chip not only from mechanical stress, but also from prolonged contact with water. Strict adherence to technology when processing nails and applying coating is also important. Therefore, it is so important to trust the hands of only an experienced specialist.<br>
