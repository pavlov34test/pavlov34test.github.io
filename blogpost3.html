    Wear gloves when doing household work. Even if the first few days are unusual, after 3-4 days you will not feel them;
apply cuticle oil daily - it strengthens nails and promotes their active growth;
in cool weather, always wear gloves - this way you protect your hand skin from the negative effects of cold air;
pamper yourself with paraffin baths - you will see the result immediately after the first application;
when performing a manicure, be sure to use a base - this way you will protect your nails from the effects of acetone, resins and other harmful substances contained in varnishes;
do not use scissors to shorten the length of your nails. Do this with files or buffs - this will prevent delamination of nails;
do nail baths at least once a week;
monitor the humidity in the room - use humidifiers or put simple jars of water;
before doing a manicure, always soften the cuticle with special products and oils;
watch your diet, take vitamins.
In fact, nail care is not that difficult. Just do it regularly and the result will not keep you waiting long!
