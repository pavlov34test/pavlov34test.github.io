    There is an opinion that regular use of gel polish harms the nail plates. It is believed that the nails should “breathe”, and the gel coating prevents this. As a result, the nails deteriorate and become brittle. Is this really so and whether the nails should "rest" from the gel polish - let's look into this. 
    The nail plate consists of dead epithelial cells, or, simply put, the skin, which turn into horny nail plates. Since these are keratinized cells, they do not need to “breathe”. Accordingly, no matter how often you apply the coating to the nail plate, this will not affect its structure in any way. Therefore, a break from gel polish is not needed for nails. 
    
    Another thing is how the gel coating is removed. Violation of technology can really adversely affect the condition of the nails. They can become thin and brittle and will require recovery. If your nail tech does everything correctly, then the gel polish coating will not ruin the nails, but, on the contrary, will protect them from external influences. There is also the opinion that the the nail plate is completely filed down before gel polish application which makes the plate very thin. Only the surface of old material is supposed to be filed down if the technology is followed correctly by your nail technician and the actual nail plate remains untouched. 
    
    So, to summarize: there is no need to be afraid of gel polish - it is absolutely safe for your nails. The main thing is to do a manicure clearly in compliance with the technology, and for this you should choose only high-quality gel polish and trust your hands only to an experienced nail specialist.

    Is a manicure just for women? But no, modern men do not think so at all. Neat and well-groomed hands have long been a must have for a strong half of humanity. What is this beauty treatment for men and how does it differ from the classic women's manicure? Manicure for men is a hygienic hand care procedure for men, after which they become neat and well-groomed. It should not be neglected by those for whom the appearance of the hands is extremely important, as part of the entire image of a person. In addition, regular manicure procedures will help prevent various nail problems. 

Unlike women's manicure, men's manicure traditionally does not use colored varnishes or gel varnishes, but special care products are used. Such a manicure consists in the processing and removal of the cuticle, shaping the nails, polishing them and in the care procedures.

Although there are exceptions to the rules - more and more often today you can find drawings on men's nails. Men's manicure in 2021 is already less discreet than it was before. Coverage and design is an increasingly popular manicure innovation for men. The design of a man's manicure looks masculine and has nothing to do with glamor. So, drawings "under a tattoo", black drawings, black and white graphics and minimalism are relevant. Don't be afraid to experiment, because trends in men's manicure have changed a lot! Go For It!
